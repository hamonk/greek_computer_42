This is my brute force solver for the greek computer.

I define 5 wheels and spent most of my time finding the numbers on each wheel.

Then I try all the combinations by rotating wheels by 1 step.

Script output shows 12 solutions - but it's just the same solution rotated 11 times.

This puzzle has only 1 solution.
